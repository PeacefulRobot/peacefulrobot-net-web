<h2>About</h2><p>Peaceful Robot Cybersecurity is a research initiative providing preventive measures for the secure software development lifecycle and creating solutions that leverage emerging technologies in Infrastructure-as-a-Service, DevOps, developer toolkits, and cybersecurity.</p>
<h2>Research</h2><p>Manual code review for information security weaknesses in programming languages such as C#, Java, PHP, Python, Javascript.</p>
<p>Normalize vulnerability patterns for various programming languages to discover weaknesses during static analysis using &quot;Cybersecurity unit testing&quot;.</p>
<p>Using Docker images, Chef recipes, and other automated toolkits such as GruntJS, build scripts, etc in git repositories to readily integrate solutions into the technology process lifecycle while still maintaining auditability.</p>
<p>Funding is provided by bug bounty programs for real-world testing and microservices of developed solutions.</p>
